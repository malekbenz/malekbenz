May be you asking yourself why should I use image Optimizer ?, so it's for a simple raison to save you bandwidth and storage space and will dramatically improve your website’s load times. 

In this post I am gonna show you  how to use Image Optimizer with visual studio. 

if you don't already have visual studio you can download a free version of visual studio [https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

## What is Image Optimizer? 

Image Optimizer is visual studio extension  that you can use  to optimize any JPEG, PNG and Gifs - including animated Gifs. It can do both lossy and lossless optimization.

- First you can download [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ImageOptimizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ImageOptimizer) 

![CMD](images/imageOptimizer/download.png){:class="img-responsive" }

- Click the file to install Install 

- Restart Visual studio

- Create / open visual studio project.


![CMD](images/imageOptimizer/imagebeforcompression.png){:class="img-responsive" }

Right-click any file or folder containing images and click one of the image optimization buttons.

![CMD](images/imageOptimizer/imagecompression.png){:class="img-responsive" }

### Lossless optimization

This will optimize the image without changing the quality of the image.

### Lossy optimizations

If you can sacrifice just a small amount of image quality (which in most cases is unnoticeable to the human eye), you will be able to save up to 90% of the initial file weight. Lossy optimization will give you outstanding results with just a fraction of image quality loss.

Now it's time for me to optimize the post images.

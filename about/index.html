        <h2>WHY I STARTED THIS BLOG?</h2>
        <p>
            I would take a moment to explain why I started this blog and more importantly what value I think YOU can get out of it.

            I wanted to create website/blog  for quite sometimes, but I wasn’t sure about what I would blog about, but I decided I’d start a blog anyway. From May 2015 I started to get involved more closely.
            
            I began to take interest in blogging. I started learning how to create a blog, how to code and how to maintain it. I created few Blogspot blogs as well. I did lot of research, reading every ebook I could. I read tons of articles, used various tools to learn the tricks of the trade. My thirst for learning the latest web technologies such as HTML, CSS equipped me with the skill of web design.

            I have learned and developed few skills in this time and I can definitively argue that I have grown both professionally and personally.

            I thought it would be a really good idea to help educate others and raise awareness along the way. I want to share what I have learned so far and what I continue to learn through blogging so that I can be of assistance in some way to improve their blogs.
            
            Here I share how I have gone about learning new things and skills.  With the explosion of online learning options available around, now we can really learn so many things quickly for very little cost or almost FREE.  You can learn skills that can help you switch into a new career field, or you could learn things that will help you make money on the side.
